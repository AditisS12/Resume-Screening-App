# Leaf-Recognition-System
Leaf Recognition System is a computer vision–based application that takes an image of a plant leaf as input and identifies the plant species. The system provides detailed information including common name, biological name, origin, regions where it is commonly found, medicinal or toxic properties, and susceptibility to common plant diseases. The model is built using CNN-based image classification and aims to support applications in agriculture, education, and environmental awareness.
